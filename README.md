# Real-Time Emotion Coach using Edge AI

A real-time emotion detection and coaching application that uses Edge AI to analyze audio (voice tone) and video (facial expressions) data locally on the device. The system provides instant feedback to help users improve their communication skills without sending sensitive data to the cloud.

## 🎯 App Description

The Real-Time Emotion Coach is an innovative application that:

- **Detects emotions in real-time** from facial expressions and voice tone
- **Processes data locally** using edge AI (no cloud dependency)
- **Provides instant coaching feedback** for communication improvement
- **Protects user privacy** by keeping all data on the device
- **Offers practical applications** for therapy, customer service training, and public speaking practice

### Key Features

- Real-time facial emotion recognition (happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, neutral)
- Voice tone analysis for emotional state detection
- Live feedback and coaching suggestions
- Privacy-focused edge computing approach
- Intuitive web-based interface
- Session data export for progress tracking

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- A webcam and microphone
- Git installed on your system

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/real-time-emotion-coach.git
cd real-time-emotion-coach
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Download Pre-trained Models

```bash
python setup_models.py
```

This script will download the required pre-trained models for emotion detection.

### Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
DEBUG=True
FLASK_ENV=development
MODEL_PATH=./models/
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Run and Usage Instructions

### Starting the Application

1. **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already activated):
   ```bash
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Using the Application

1. **Grant Permissions**: When prompted, allow camera and microphone access
2. **Start Detection**: Click the "Start Detection" button
3. **Begin Speaking**: Start a conversation or practice speaking
4. **View Real-time Feedback**: 
   - Emotion levels are displayed as progress bars
   - Coaching feedback appears in the feedback panel
5. **Stop Detection**: Click "Stop Detection" when finished
6. **Export Data**: Use the export feature to save session data for analysis

### Troubleshooting

**Camera/Microphone Issues**:
- Ensure your browser has permission to access camera/microphone
- Check if other applications are using the camera
- Try refreshing the page and granting permissions again

**Model Loading Issues**:
- Run `python setup_models.py` again to re-download models
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space

**Performance Issues**:
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Try using a different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Reduce video quality in browser settings if needed
